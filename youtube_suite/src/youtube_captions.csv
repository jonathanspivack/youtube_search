Reviewer: Ellen Maloney"
00:15,"So, I was on a roll."
00:16,"I was an executive with a nice salary,"
00:18,"annual bonuses, and stock options,"
00:20,all the perks.
00:22,Everything was on track.
00:24,"And on Monday, January 7th, 2008"
00:28,"at three o'clock in the afternoon,"
00:30,"in a small conference room
on the top floor of our building,"
00:33,"the president of the company
wanted to have a quick meeting with me,"
00:36,which wasn't unusual since he was my boss.
00:39,"But the meeting turned out
to be even more brief than expected."
00:44,He fired me.
00:46,"And I'll never forget how his words
just sucked the breath right out of me,"
00:53,"and I left the conference room
in a dazed state,"
00:56,"and I went home and curled up in my bed
in the fetal position for three hours."
01:01,"And while I could go on
in vivid detail about how I felt,"
01:04,"what it did to my self-esteem,
my finances, and so on,"
01:08,"what I now realize is,"
01:09,"while that event created the greatest
amount of discomfort I had ever felt,"
01:15,"it was that discomfort,"
01:17,"the departure from my ordered life,"
01:20,that forever changed it for the better.
01:23,"You see, friends,"
01:24,"what makes you comfortable can ruin you,"
01:27,"and what makes you uncomfortable
is the only way to grow."
01:31,Let me say that again:
01:32,"What makes you comfortable can ruin you,"
01:34,"and only in a state of discomfort,
can you continually grow."
01:39,"Now, I suppose if on January 8th,
had somebody come up and said,"
01:42,"""Gee buddy, getting fired is a good thing
because now you're really going to grow!"""
01:46,I probably would have smacked them.
01:48,"But, pretty quickly I became motivated
to start a new journey,"
01:53,"and after a couple years
of work with my new team"
01:55,"and a PhD friend
at the University of Nebraska,"
01:58,we had this epiphany
02:00,"on how to illustrate and apply
the science of discomfort and growth."
02:06,"We called the concept: the ""Growth Rings."""
02:10,"The Growth Rings represent
living environments"
02:13,that promote or hinder growth.
02:15,"And that includes everything
from your place of work,"
02:18,to even a fishbowl.
02:20,"You see, what dictates
the size of a goldfish"
02:23,is its environment.
02:25,"And while this goldfish
lives in a very safe environment,"
02:28,it's also very limiting in most every way.
02:30,"And when placed
in a more robust environment,"
02:33,"like, say, a small pond,
this can be the result."
02:37,"Now, it also means he could be eaten."
02:40,"But friends, this is you -"
02:43,"the environments
in which you work, live, and play,"
02:46,"they're all a proverbial fishbowl
that dictates your growth."
02:51,"So, the first Growth Ring represents
a low-performing, low-growth environment,"
02:56,called stagnation.
02:58,"Stagnation is understood
by having to follow too many steps,"
03:01,"and permissions, and minutiae."
03:03,"That stifles creativity,
independent thought, and action."
03:08,"To imagine an environment such as this,"
03:10,"think no further than our state
and federal governments."
03:14,"Now, the antithesis
of stagnation is chaos,"
03:18,also low-growth and low-performing.
03:20,"Chaos can be caused by internal
or external events or conditions."
03:25,"We see chaos occur at times
in business mergers,"
03:28,"natural disasters,
and horrific events like 9/11."
03:31,"Chaos is having
zero predictability or control"
03:36,over inputs and outcomes.
03:40,"Coming back down the Growth Rings,"
03:41,"next to stagnation is
the most desirable environment: order."
03:46,"Order is knowing that what you do,
or what is happening in your environment,"
03:51,leads to a predictable outcome.
03:54,"And in predictability, comfort is found."
03:58,"But comfort is also
what makes order so dangerous."
04:01,"Because science shows that anytime
you continually do something,"
04:04,"or even think about something
the same way,"
04:07,you'll eventually stop growing.
04:10,And this applies to every living thing -
04:12,even our dog.
04:16,"You see, if Aspen had a chance,"
04:18,"she'd choose comfort six days a week
and twice on Sundays."
04:22,(Laughter)
04:23,But too much growth-limiting order
04:25,"would have prevented her
from becoming a therapy dog,"
04:30,"and had this been allowed,"
04:32,"think of the lives this gentle soul
would not be touching today."
04:38,"So, before your order continues
to limit the way you think and act,"
04:43,remember what I said earlier:
04:46,"Growth only occurs
in a state of discomfort."
04:48,"Now, think about the power of that phrase:"
04:51,"Growth only occurs
in a state of discomfort."
04:54,"I can unequivocally state,
I wouldn't be standing on this stage today"
04:58,"without my uncomfortable,
order-disrupting day, nine years ago -"
05:04,"by the way I'm not recommending you go
get fired to see if it leads to a TEDTalk."
05:08,(Laughter)
05:09,"When you feel discomfort hit,"
05:13,"that means you've entered
the complexity ring."
05:17,"Complexity is nothing more
than changed order,"
05:22,"but when your order is changed,
outcomes are no longer predictable,"
05:27,"and it's unpredictability
that makes you uncomfortable."
05:31,And while most times
05:33,"your visceral response to discomfort
is not just ""No"" but ""Hell, no,"""
05:37,"you can actually learn
how empowering it is"
05:40,"to consciously acknowledge discomfort,"
05:43,"and then, when appropriate,
choose complexity over order."
05:47,"And I know seeking discomfort sounds odd,
and not many people do it,"
05:51,but you have to learn to embrace it
05:53,because it's the only environment
05:55,"where sustained
or exponential growth can occur."
06:01,Okay.
06:02,"To weave high-growth complexity
into the fabric of your lives,"
06:07,"there are three primary ways
it can be triggered."
06:12,"Complexity trigger number one
is it can be forced upon you."
06:16,"When I got fired, I didn't have
a chance to stay in order,"
06:20,"complexity was selected for me,
and when this happens,"
06:24,"how much you grow
depends on how you respond to it."
06:27,"Now, I could have remained angry,
I could have used it as an excuse,"
06:30,"but what I actually learned
is that I suck as an employee,"
06:35,"and I'm much better off accepting
the risks of running my own company."
06:41,"Complexity trigger number two:
Someone can help you get there."
06:45,"This is the role of parents,
teachers, coaches, and bosses."
06:51,"Because left on their own,"
06:53,"people will consciously or subconsciously
select the comfort of order."
06:59,"And they then need to be
pushed into complexity"
07:02,in order to continue growing.
07:05,"My youngest daughter
spent most of her high school life"
07:10,"training to play tennis,"
07:11,"and her coach was
pretty familiar with our work"
07:14,on complexity and the Growth Rings.
07:16,"So, I called him up one day
to check on Maddie's progress,"
07:19,"and I was able to phrase
my question like this, I said:"
07:22,"""Hey, Lee, how long has it been"
07:24,"since Maddie's been pushed
deep into complexity?"""
07:27,Lee's response:
07:28,"""Hmm, funny you'd ask Bill.
We got there yesterday."
07:32,"She broke down into tears
on the tennis court."""
07:36,"""Huh."""
07:38,"Well, knowing how tough my daughter is,
and the fact that she never cries,"
07:43,told me she was deep into complexity.
07:45,"But, friends, this is where critical
developmental decisions are made"
07:51,"because the old Bill,
the pre-Growth Ring Bill,"
07:54,"would have intervened and wanted to know
what was making her so uncomfortable."
07:59,"Then I would have done everything I could
to try and get her happy again."
08:02,What I really would have been doing
08:05,"is removing the complexity,
and putting her in order."
08:08,"I actually would have been stifling
her development."
08:13,"But the new, post-Growth Ring Bill
relished in his daughter's discomfort."
08:18,(Laughter)
08:20,"And it was the coach's next words
that told me everything I needed to hear."
08:25,"He said, ""Bill, I've got to tell you,
it took a heck of a lot more"
08:29,"to get her to the limits
of complexity this month,"
08:32,"than it did last month."""
08:35,Discomfort was causing her growth.
08:39,"Okay, but what if you're not lucky enough"
08:43,"to live or work in a robust
high-growth environment?"
08:46,"What if you're stuck in order,
even worse, stagnation?"
08:51,"Well, the great news is,"
08:53,"everyone can trigger
complexity at any time."
08:57,"So, complexity trigger number three:
Trigger it yourself."
09:03,"Take a journey with me
back to Montgomery, Alabama"
09:07,in the 1950s.
09:08,"Imagine, if you will
a young girl, who's black,"
09:12,and she attends an all-black high school.
09:14,"And she takes the city bus
to get there and home,"
09:16,which wasn't unusual in that era.
09:19,"And on March 2, 1955,
she boards a bus to come home from school,"
09:24,"and she sits near the back,"
09:25,"in the first row of seats
where blacks were allowed to sit."
09:29,"And as the bus continues
to fill with white people,"
09:32,"there's eventually
no more room in the front."
09:34,And according to local law
09:36,"she needed to move further back
to create room for white people to sit."
09:41,"You see, Montgomery had an order in place"
09:45,"that when followed,
led to a very predictable outcome:"
09:49,repression of people with little conflict.
09:54,But 15-year-old Claudette Colvin
09:57,"had just spent the last month
in high school studying black history,"
10:00,"and she was understandably fed up
with the historic and existing atrocities."
10:04,"And so on this day, she decided
she didn't like Montgomery's order,"
10:10,"and by refusing to give up her seat,"
10:12,"she sent a community, our laws,
and our entire country into complexity."
10:19,"Yes, nine months before Rosa Parks
made her famous decision to stay put,"
10:24,it was a 15-year-old girl
10:26,"that was handcuffed, dragged
from the bus, and taken to prison."
10:30,"It was Miss Colvin, not Rosa Parks,
who first fought the law,"
10:34,"and by the way,"
10:35,"was also the star plaintiff to testify
in the famous lawsuit"
10:38,"that went all the way
to the US Supreme Court."
10:42,"So,"
10:44,"I use Claudette's actions
not to heighten awareness of race issues,"
10:49,"although that's not necessarily bad,"
10:52,"but I used it as an example
of every issue,"
10:54,"of every situation
in an ordered environment."
10:58,"It's a real and perfect example
of complexity forcing people,"
11:02,"our communities,
and our courts into discomfort,"
11:05,and the downstream impact that can occur
11:09,anytime someone elects to move from order.
11:14,"Dr. Serene Jones, in a recent book,
summarizes this concept very eloquently."
11:21,"She said: ""The constant facade of order"
11:24,"hides the wilderness that is craving
to seep out and teach us"
11:28,"that life wasn't created
to be what we think it is."
11:31,"Beyond words, we must
experience the wilderness"
11:34,"to be taught what cannot
be otherwise known."""
11:40,"So, friends,"
11:42,"it's not the discomfort of losing a job,"
11:45,"it's not having a child break down
on the tennis court,"
11:48,"but it's order you should fear the most
because it is a threat."
11:52,And order-disrupting people
11:54,"like Jesus, Galileo,
Claudette Colvin, Aspen's trainer,"
12:00,"and maybe even a few of you
have already proven -"
12:03,"now, think about this -"
12:05,"it's not the complexity-triggering
individuals or events"
12:09,"you should fear the most,"
12:11,"but it's your own willingness
to accept or seek discomfort"
12:16,"that will dictate the growth
of not just you,"
12:20,but our entire world.
12:22,"Thank you very much
for allowing me to be a part of this."
12:25,(Applause)
